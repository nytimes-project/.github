# 6th March Meeting
Listing things to discuss and to do

1. Determine research questions: to better guide characterization and classification and writeup
    - What type of comment is more likely to be selected by the editor? Does emotion/toxicity affect the editor selection? Is it affected by sections?
    - What does specific event affect the number of comments/user engagement/editor pick choice?
    - General stats of comments, e.g. what time do they post?
    
    - Could the comments whether be picked by editors be predicted automaticly?
    - Could automatic algorithms help editors inspect and select suitable comments?


  
 2. Not analyzing across ten years. Instead, pick out certain year's data and do the analysis
    - Bad lines
    - Different data type across different years
    - Inconsistency in section/subsection names across years
